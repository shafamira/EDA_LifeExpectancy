# EDA_LifeExpectancy
1) Correlation between dependent variable and independent variables
Dependent variable: Life.expectancy
Independent variables: Year, Adult.Mortality, infant.deaths, Alcohol, percentage.expenditure, Hepatitis.B, Measles, BMI, under.five.deaths, Polio, Total.expenditure, Diphtheria, HIV.AIDS, GDP, Population, thinness..1.19.years, thinness.5.9.years, Income.composition.of.resources, Schooling

2) Statistical testing
- How is the distribution of life expectancy in this dataset divided into specific quantiles?
- Is the minimum value of the life expectancy variable is in a normal distribution with the mean and standard deviation of the variable?
- What are the quantile values of a normal distribution with specified mean and standard deviation, for ten different probabilities, ranging from 0 to 1 with intervals of 0.1?
- Is there a significant difference between the average life expectancy in this dataset and the specified population mean value (69.22493 years)?

3) Predictive modeling in R and Python
Predictive modeling in R and Python are both done with the same model, the Random Forest Tree. The MSE results generated by the model created with python are smaller so this indicates that the performance of the model in predicting the target value on data that has never been seen before (testing data) is better than the model created with R.
